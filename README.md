# PID-at-BelleII-using-Machine-Learning
The Belle II experiment employs the information from six sub-detectors (SVD, CDC, TOP, ARICH, ECL, and KLM) to identify a particle (electron, muon, pion, kaon, proton, or deuteron). This thesis aims to Investigate different machine learning models to improve K/$\pi$ separation. The XGBoost model outperforms the standard method for particle identification employed at Belle II, as well as other machine-learning based methods with an AUC score of 0.966.
